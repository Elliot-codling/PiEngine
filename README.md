PiEngine is a 2D graphics library enhancer. It provides pre-written functions for a developer to use. These functions help accelerate game development as the user does not need to write their own functions to produce similar results that PiEngine can create. PiEnigne is very flexible in what it can do and aims for many platforms and hardware configurations.

Supported platforms:

- Windows 7 or later
- MacOS X 10.9 or later
- Linux

Recommended platforms:

- Windows 10 or later
- MacOS X 10.13 or later
- Linux Kernel version 4.0 or later

As well as supporting the most popular platforms on the market, this Engine is specifically designed to be used for the Raspberry Pi platforms (Raspberry Pi 2 or later). Hence the name “PiEngine”.
# <a name="_mmgvlxfvcsk0"></a>Future Revisions
Later revisions will incorporate new features from other popular Game Engines. I plan to include the following:

- Multi-processing
- GamePad support
- Lighting support
- User interface

Additionally, PiEngine will be compiled to work on MicroPython intended for the RP2040. Simply drag and drop your game with little changes to the code and the PiEngine will do the rest!

It is recommended to purchase the Pimoroni PicoSystem so games can be easily transferred with little changes to your code.
